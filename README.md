# Odin-Weather-App
The weather app project from The Odin Project

## Description
A simple weather app where the user can input a location and it will show a weather summary for that location. The layout shows current conditions, weekly summary, and an hourly summary for today.

## Use
* Enter a location into the top right and press search.
* The screen will then populate with all the data.
* The last search is saved in the browser (search will not update to new conditions if reloaded, will stay on the day and time of the last search).
